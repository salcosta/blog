Not gonna lie, I straight up neglected this blog for a while. I changed jobs and wasn't coding as much but I still had a lot to say.

Kept trying to get into WordPress but I just Wasn't loving it so I have migrated the blog to a simple static site on GH pages. More my style.

I will try to post regularly. In this moment I am really motivated and I hope that motivation doesn't dry up in a week.

I have a new project and I will be posting about that, as well as trying to blogify some of my more coherent reddit comments. In between I may post about life, philosophy, relationships, non-techy stuff and whatever else I get the feeling to talk about. Which is the long way to say "anything".
